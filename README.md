[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/helium/plumtree.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/helium/plumtree)

Plumtree is an implementation of Plumtree[1], the epidemic broadcast protocol.
It is extracted from the implementation in riak_core[2]. Instead of
the riak_core ring and riak's ring gossip protocol, it includes a standalone
membership gossip, built around riak_dt[3]'s ORSWOT[4].

More information on the plumtree protocol and it's history we encourage you
to watch Jordan West's RICON West 2013 talk[5] and Joao Leitao & Jordan West's
RICON 2014 talk[6].

A special thanks to Jordan, Joao and the team at Basho for providing much of
the code contained in this library.
